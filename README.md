analyzer of AC line junkbox, Dreamed by BingAI 

Junkbox of AC line analyzers.
Ideally a set of networked ESP32 line analyzers should be enough to measure Watt consumption of each connected device by measuring voltage differences in the grid points. 

Of course other features like harmonic distortion can be easily measured too.

It's brainstorming junkbox so far, not a complete system.
Biggest problem is how to settle on one method of AC voltage measurement - to measure full AC cycle one needs array, this array needs to be shared across the network and correlated etc.
