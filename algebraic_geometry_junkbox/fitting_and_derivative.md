Sure! Here's an example code demonstrating how to use the Wedge library with an ESP32 in the Arduino IDE to analyze a series of sampled signals from a sensor and fit it to a 3rd order polynomial.

### Setup

1. **Install the Wedge library**: First, ensure that you have the Wedge library installed. You can download it from the Arduino Library Manager.
2. **Hardware Setup**: Connect your sensor to the ESP32 and make sure it is properly wired to an appropriate analog input pin.

### Example Code

```cpp
#include <Wedge.h>

// Define the analog pin for the sensor
const int sensorPin = A0;

// Number of samples
const int numSamples = 100;

// Array to store sensor readings
float sensorReadings[numSamples];

// Variables to store the coefficients of the 3rd order polynomial
float a, b, c, d;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // Read sensor values
  for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    sensorReadings[i] = analogRead(sensorPin);
    delay(10); // Delay to simulate sampling interval
  }
  
  // Fit the data to a 3rd order polynomial
  fitPolynomial();
  
  // Print the polynomial coefficients
  Serial.println("Polynomial coefficients:");
  Serial.print("a: "); Serial.println(a);
  Serial.print("b: "); Serial.println(b);
  Serial.print("c: "); Serial.println(c);
  Serial.print("d: "); Serial.println(d);
}

void loop() {
  // Here you can use the polynomial coefficients to process further if needed
}

// Function to fit the sensor readings to a 3rd order polynomial
void fitPolynomial() {
  // Create a Wedge object
  Wedge wedge;
  
  // Variables to store sums required for polynomial fitting
  float sumX = 0, sumX2 = 0, sumX3 = 0, sumX4 = 0, sumX5 = 0, sumX6 = 0;
  float sumY = 0, sumXY = 0, sumX2Y = 0, sumX3Y = 0;
  
  // Calculate the sums
  for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    float x = i;
    float y = sensorReadings[i];
    float x2 = x * x;
    float x3 = x2 * x;
    float x4 = x3 * x;
    float x5 = x4 * x;
    float x6 = x5 * x;
    
    sumX += x;
    sumX2 += x2;
    sumX3 += x3;
    sumX4 += x4;
    sumX5 += x5;
    sumX6 += x6;
    sumY += y;
    sumXY += x * y;
    sumX2Y += x2 * y;
    sumX3Y += x3 * y;
  }
  
  // Create the matrices
  float A[4][4] = {
    {numSamples, sumX, sumX2, sumX3},
    {sumX, sumX2, sumX3, sumX4},
    {sumX2, sumX3, sumX4, sumX5},
    {sumX3, sumX4, sumX5, sumX6}
  };
  
  float B[4] = {sumY, sumXY, sumX2Y, sumX3Y};
  
  // Solve the linear system to get the coefficients
  float coefficients[4];
  wedge.solve(A, B, coefficients);
  
  // Assign the coefficients
  d = coefficients[0];
  c = coefficients[1];
  b = coefficients[2];
  a = coefficients[3];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Library Inclusion**: Include the Wedge library for polynomial fitting.
2. **Sensor Reading**: Read a series of samples from the sensor connected to `sensorPin` and store them in an array.
3. **Polynomial Fitting**:
   - Compute the necessary sums for fitting a 3rd order polynomial.
   - Create matrices for the linear system derived from the polynomial fitting equations.
   - Use the Wedge library to solve this linear system and obtain the coefficients.
4. **Output**: Print the coefficients of the polynomial.

### Note

Ensure that you have the correct Wedge library and adjust any specific implementation details as necessary based on the actual library functions and your specific sensor setup. This example provides a general framework for fitting a polynomial to sensor data using an ESP32.

Sure, let's break down how algebraic geometry is used in the example above to solve the system of equations for fitting a 3rd order polynomial to the sampled sensor data. This includes a deeper look into the internal logic of the Wedge library.

### Polynomial Fitting

To fit a 3rd order polynomial \( y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) to a set of data points \((x_i, y_i)\), we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). This is done using least squares fitting, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values \(y_i\) and the values predicted by the polynomial.

### Setting Up the System of Equations

1. **Matrix Construction**:
   We form a system of linear equations by summing over all the data points. The sums are calculated as follows:

   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   \text{Sum of powers of } x: & \quad \sum x_i, \sum x_i^2, \sum x_i^3, \sum x_i^4, \sum x_i^5, \sum x_i^6 \\
   \text{Sum of } y \text{ and } xy: & \quad \sum y_i, \sum x_i y_i, \sum x_i^2 y_i, \sum x_i^3 y_i
   \end{aligned}
   \]

2. **Linear System**:
   These sums form the elements of a matrix equation \( A \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b} \), where \(A\) is a 4x4 matrix, \(\mathbf{c}\) is the vector of coefficients \([d, c, b, a]\), and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the vector of summed products:

   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   A &= \begin{pmatrix}
   n & \sum x_i & \sum x_i^2 & \sum x_i^3 \\
   \sum x_i & \sum x_i^2 & \sum x_i^3 & \sum x_i^4 \\
   \sum x_i^2 & \sum x_i^3 & \sum x_i^4 & \sum x_i^5 \\
   \sum x_i^3 & \sum x_i^4 & \sum x_i^5 & \sum x_i^6
   \end{pmatrix} \\
   \mathbf{c} &= \begin{pmatrix}
   d \\
   c \\
   b \\
   a
   \end{pmatrix} \\
   \mathbf{b} &= \begin{pmatrix}
   \sum y_i \\
   \sum x_i y_i \\
   \sum x_i^2 y_i \\
   \sum x_i^3 y_i
   \end{pmatrix}
   \end{aligned}
   \]

### Solving the Linear System

This linear system can be solved using various numerical methods. The Wedge library likely employs one or more of the following techniques:

1. **Gaussian Elimination**: This is a method for solving linear systems by transforming the matrix into an upper triangular form and then performing back substitution to find the solution vector \(\mathbf{c}\).

2. **LU Decomposition**: This involves decomposing matrix \(A\) into a product of a lower triangular matrix \(L\) and an upper triangular matrix \(U\). The system \(A \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b}\) can then be solved in two steps: solving \(L \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{b}\) for \(\mathbf{y}\) using forward substitution, and then solving \(U \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}\) for \(\mathbf{c}\) using back substitution.

### Wedge Library Internal Logic

While the exact implementation details of the Wedge library are not provided, a typical internal logic might look like this:

1. **Matrix Construction**: Calculate the sums and form matrix \(A\) and vector \(\mathbf{b}\) as shown above.
2. **Solve Linear System**: Use a numerical method (like Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition) to solve \(A \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b}\).
3. **Return Coefficients**: Extract the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) from the solution vector \(\mathbf{c}\) and return them.

### Example Implementation in Wedge Library

Here is a hypothetical implementation of the core logic using Gaussian elimination:

```cpp
class Wedge {
public:
  void solve(float A[4][4], float B[4], float coefficients[4]) {
    int n = 4;
    // Gaussian Elimination
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // Pivot
      for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
        if (fabs(A[i][i]) < fabs(A[k][i])) {
          for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            std::swap(A[i][j], A[k][j]);
          }
          std::swap(B[i], B[k]);
        }
      }
      // Eliminate
      for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
        float factor = A[k][i] / A[i][i];
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
          A[k][j] -= factor * A[i][j];
        }
        B[k] -= factor * B[i];
      }
    }
    // Back substitution
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      coefficients[i] = B[i];
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        coefficients[i] -= A[i][j] * coefficients[j];
      }
      coefficients[i] /= A[i][i];
    }
  }
};
```

### Conclusion

By solving this system of linear equations, we obtain the coefficients of the 3rd order polynomial that best fits the sampled sensor data. This process, rooted in algebraic geometry and linear algebra, enables us to model and analyze sensor data efficiently. The Wedge library simplifies this process by providing functions to handle the underlying numerical methods.

The coefficients of the polynomial \(y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\) can be used to compute its derivatives, which provide valuable insights into the behavior of the sensor data, such as identifying points where the sensor reading reaches a maximum or minimum.

### Calculating the Derivative

The first derivative of the polynomial represents the rate of change of the sensor data with respect to time (or the sample index, in this context). The derivative of \(y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\) is:

\[ y' = \frac{dy}{dx} = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c \]

### Finding Critical Points

Critical points occur where the first derivative equals zero. These points indicate potential maxima, minima, or inflection points in the data:

\[ 3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-2b \pm \sqrt{(2b)^2 - 4 \cdot 3a \cdot c}}{2 \cdot 3a} = \frac{-2b \pm \sqrt{4b^2 - 12ac}}{6a} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{3a} \]

### Determining the Nature of Critical Points

To determine whether a critical point is a maximum or a minimum, we compute the second derivative of the polynomial:

\[ y'' = \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 6ax + 2b \]

- If \( y'' > 0 \) at a critical point, it is a local minimum.
- If \( y'' < 0 \) at a critical point, it is a local maximum.

### Implementing in Code

Here's how to implement these steps in the Arduino code:

```cpp

  // Calculate the sums

    float x = i;
    float y = sensorReadings[i];
    float x2 = x * x;

  }
  
  // Create the matrices

  };
  
  float B[4] = {sumY, sumXY, sumX2Y, sumX3Y};
  
  // Solve the linear system to get the coefficients
  float coefficients[4];
  wedge.solve(A, B, coefficients);
  
  // Assign the coefficients
  d = coefficients[0];
  c = coefficients[1];

  a = coefficients[3];
}

void findCriticalPoints() {
  // Solve the quadratic equation 3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0
  float discriminant = b * b - 3 * a * c;
  
  if (discriminant < 0) {
    Serial.println("No real roots, no critical points.");
    return;
  }
  
  float x1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (3 * a);
  float x2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (3 * a);
  
  // Evaluate the second derivative at these points
  float y1_prime2 = 6 * a * x1 + 2 * b;
  float y2_prime2 = 6 * a * x2 + 2 * b;

  } else if (y2_prime2 < 0) {
    Serial.println("Local maximum");
  } else {

  }
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Fitting Polynomial**:
   - The `fitPolynomial` function calculates the coefficients of the polynomial that best fits the sensor data using the Wedge library.

2. **Finding Critical Points**:
   - The `findCriticalPoints` function solves the first derivative equation \(3ax^2 + 2bx + c = 0\) to find potential critical points.
   - It evaluates the second derivative at these points to determine if they are maxima, minima, or inflection points.

3. **Output**:
   - The polynomial coefficients and the nature of the critical points are printed to the serial monitor.

By finding these critical points and determining their nature, you can identify specific events in the sensor data, such as peaks (local maxima), which might indicate significant events like reaching a maximum value. This method can be extended to monitor and respond to various conditions based on the behavior of the sensor data.
