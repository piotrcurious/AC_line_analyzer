The provided implementation of the `Wedge` class seems to be correct for solving a system of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Gaussian Elimination:**
   - The code iterates through the elements of the coefficient matrix `A` in a loop.
   - For each pivot row `i`, it performs partial pivoting to find a row with a larger absolute value on the diagonal element (`A[i][i]`).
   - If a better pivot row is found, it swaps the rows in both the coefficient matrix `A` and the right-hand side vector `B`.
   - Then, it performs elimination for the current pivot row. It calculates a factor for each row below the pivot row and subtracts this factor multiplied by the pivot row from the corresponding row. This effectively eliminates the variable from the lower rows.

2. **Back substitution:**
   - After the Gaussian Elimination step, the upper triangular matrix is obtained.
   - The code performs back substitution to solve for the solution vector `coefficients`.
   - It starts from the last row (n-1) and iterates backwards.
   - For each row `i`, it calculates the value of the `i`th coefficient by subtracting the contribution of the variables after it from the right-hand side element `B[i]`.
   - Finally, it divides by the diagonal element `A[i][i]` to get the final solution value for the `i`th coefficient.

**Potential improvements:**

1. **Handling singular matrices:**
   - The current implementation doesn't explicitly handle cases where the coefficient matrix `A` is singular (determinant is zero). In such cases, solving the linear system is not possible. You might want to add checks for singularity during pivoting and raise an exception or indicate an error condition.

2. **Efficiency for large systems:**
   - For larger systems, the partial pivoting step can become computationally expensive. You might explore using a more efficient pivoting strategy like complete pivoting or LU decomposition.

Overall, the `Wedge` class implementation seems to be a functional implementation of Gaussian Elimination for solving linear systems. However, incorporating checks for singularity and considering more efficient pivoting techniques for larger systems could improve its robustness and performance.**

The code you provided has a good structure for fitting sensor readings to a 3rd order polynomial and finding critical points. Here are some potential problems to consider:

**1. Dependence on untested library:**

* The code relies on a library called "Wedge.h" which is not included. Without knowing the implementation of the `solve` function, it's impossible to be certain it works correctly. 
* Make sure the Wedge library is properly installed and functional. You can test the `solve` function independently or find an alternative library for solving linear systems.

**2. Potential for numerical instability:**

* Gaussian elimination, used by the `solve` function, can be susceptible to numerical errors for ill-conditioned matrices (matrices with very small or very large values). 
* This might lead to inaccurate results for the polynomial coefficients. Consider using a more robust method like LU decomposition for solving the linear system.

**3. Handling of singular matrices:**

* The code doesn't explicitly handle cases where the coefficient matrix `A` is singular (determinant is zero). 
* In such cases, solving the linear system is not possible. You might want to add checks for singularity and handle it gracefully, perhaps by indicating an error or using a different method for fitting.

**4. Limited error handling:**

* The code doesn't handle potential errors during sensor readings or calculations. 
* Consider adding checks for invalid sensor values (e.g., negative readings) and implementing error handling for potential mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero).

**5. Efficiency for large datasets:**

* The current implementation calculates sums needed for the polynomial fit within the `fitPolynomial` function for every loop iteration. 
* For larger datasets, this can be inefficient. You can optimize by calculating these sums outside the loop during data collection.

These are some potential issues to consider. The severity of these problems depends on the specific application and the characteristics of your sensor data.
